# Simple-Sales-Analysis-
This project contains several data files that were merged into one main file. The data was analyzed for 12 months of sales of a sector in the United States of America.
The analysis was simple in addition to the final output representation. Where I advise beginners in the field of data analysis to start with this project. I also thank https://twitter.com/keithgalli for his efforts, as he was relied upon as a source in the implementation of the project, while following my own method and style.
